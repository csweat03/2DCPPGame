# 2D C++ Game

This is a basic game developed in C++. This uses SFML, and is made to learn memory management, C++ syntax, and game-design. This project welcomes collaborations.

## Lessons Learned

The main lesson learned is that I now understand intricate memory management/manipulation.

Why garbage collection is costly? *Constantly searching for unused objects to be discarded.*

Why garbage collection is beneficial? *Controls memory leaks, more friendly towrads developers.*

Why garbage collection is used in most modern languages despite the inefficiency? *Benefit outweighs the cost in most use cases, or a languages is so high-level the difference is negligible.*

Why developers use game engines, even for 2D games? 
*It took me 30 minutes to make a player (a red square) that interpolates for player movement 
and has realistic velocity. If I wanted to apply a texture to the 'player' that would require a fundamental recode, 
versus just adding a different entity into the world. Not to mention the loss of development time for a negligible efficiency gain.*
